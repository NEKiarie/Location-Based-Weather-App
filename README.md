## Deliverables

The data is rendered through two APIs(OpenWeather API(Weather Data), MapBox API(Geocoding Locations)) and is available for consumption by the frontend.

As a user, I can:

1. Search for a location by typing the name into the search bar.
   
2. Select a location within the results. This will take you to the current weather for your selection

3. Track the location by clicking on the "+" icon on the top right. This will save the location to view at a later time on the Homepage.
   
4. If you no longer wish to track a location, simply select a location within the Homepage. At the bottom of the page, there will be an option to delete the location.
